          The Wasdale Head Inn is a traditional Lakeland Inn, situated in the
          heart of Wasdale, the deepest valley in England. The Inn is a
          family-run business, and has been in the same family for over 100
          years. The Inn is a popular destination for walkers, climbers and
          cyclists, and is a great place to relax after a day in the fells.
